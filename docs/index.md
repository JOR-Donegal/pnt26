# Introduction

!!! abstract "Physical Network Theory"

These notes on data communications are a basic introduction and are intended to let us share a basis of terminology and understanding. Many of the topics I will cover require a rigorous, theoretical treatment to understand properly. That is not what is intended here!

Much of the magic of modern technology emerges because we can communicate between devices and thus between people. Even the most far-fetched sci-fi of the 1960s did not include the iPhone or ubiquitous connectivity and the changes since the pandemic have established communication technology as being one of the key enablers of modern civilization.

There are key terms. These will be _italicized_. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them.

Commands are generally shown in __bold__.
