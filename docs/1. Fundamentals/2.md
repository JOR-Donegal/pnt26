# Asynchronous Serial Communications
One of the oldest and simplest ways we can communicate is via serial links. Ones and zeros are represented as voltage levels and each bit follows the other down a wire. Imagine we had a keyboard connected via a serial link to a computer. We would be sending one character at a time, the user could press a key at any random time, so characters could come down the wire at any time. This is called an asynchronous link. We need a way to distinguish the start of a character; this is called the start bit and will always be a 1 (because if it was a 0, we could not distinguish it from a line with no activity). After this, we could transmit our character. In early systems, we did this using 7 bits. We need to be able to show that we have finished sending the character. This is because there is no timing information between the two sides of a link. The only way we can synchronize the two sides is to know where a character starts and stops. Normally we use two stop bits.

In the example shown, we have a single character being sent, with the binary code 0110010. We mentioned timing above. Our serial links can have a range of speeds; the standard bit rate speeds are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400. I have seen a 400kb/s speed quoted.

There are many examples of standard protocols which use serial links. The most common is RS-232. This is an old standard now and most laptops no longer have it. Every technical person has an adapter in their laptop case which allows them to use RS-232 over USB and you can buy an adapter like that on line for a few euros. If you don’t have one ORDER ONE NOW! You cannot configure network equipment of appliances without it. When you connect to a Cisco switch or router via a blue serial cable, this is RS-232.

If you are doing longer range serial connections, you might use a standard like RS-422 or RS-485. For very long connections in industrial sites, we use a 4-20mA current loop. For IoT sensors, I use 1-wire devices, a specific proprietary protocol that is both simple and cheap.
