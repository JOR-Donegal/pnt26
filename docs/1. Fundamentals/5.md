# Unicode
ASCII was very limited with no support for languages, symbols etc. Unicode was a solution developed in the late 1980s and standardized in 1991. Unicode standardized numeric representations for symbols required for international writing. Unicode is backward compatible with ASCII (UTF-8). A Unicode character is represented by the format U+ followed by the character code in HEX. For example, U+0041 is the ASCII character A. The most recent specification for UNICODE is Unicode v.6.

ASCII has now been superseded by UNICODE. Do some background reading on ASCII and UNICODE and ensure you understand it.
