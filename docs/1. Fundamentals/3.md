# Synchronous Communications
In some cases, we need something more precise than asynchronous communications. It may be desirable for us to synchronize the two sides of a communication circuit by including a clock signal on a separate line.

Using synchronous circuits, we can connect at multi-megabit rates. When you use legacy thick Cisco serial cables to connect to serial WAN ports on a router, this is a synchronous connection.
