# Analog and Digital

We tend to have two distinct types of signal which we deal with. The word _analogue_ means that we are representing a value which continuously varies. For example, the fuel gauge in a car can indicate from full to empty and can indicate any value in between. An analogue signal has a theoretically infinite resolution.

_Digital_ systems have distinct values like “1” or “0”. If I have a digital fuel gauge, it typically shows 10 steps from full to empty. In circuits, we tend to deal with _logic levels_ where for example +5V is a one and 0V is a zero.

A computer is primarily made up of digital components and circuits which tend to have very defined signal levels to represent ones and zeros.

A guitar amplifier is (probably!) entirely made of analogue circuits; typically, a pre-amplifier and a power amplifier. And the really fun ones still use thermionic valves (look it up).

A telephone exchange will have both types of circuit, analogue electronics to process incoming and outgoing voice signals to the user and digital circuits to transmit voice between exchanges.

A signal with a one or zero level is binary, the signal will be above a threshold value for 1 and below a threshold value for 0.

There is another alternative where we can send multiple voltage levels and where one symbol can be transmitted per voltage level. For example, suppose we make 0V equal to 00, 1V equal to 01, 2V equal 10 and 3V equal to 11. When we have transmitted two bits of information for each symbol we transmit; this is very efficient. We refer to a multi-level system like this as an m-ary system, where m is the number of levels.

# Asynchronous Serial Communications
One of the oldest and simplest ways we can communicate is via serial links. Ones and zeros are represented as voltage levels and each bit follows the other down a wire. Imagine we had a keyboard connected via a serial link to a computer. We would be sending one character at a time, the user could press a key at any random time, so characters could come down the wire at any time. This is called an asynchronous link. We need a way to distinguish the start of a character; this is called the start bit and will always be a 1 (because if it was a 0, we could not distinguish it from a line with no activity). After this, we could transmit our character. In early systems, we did this using 7 bits. We need to be able to show that we have finished sending the character. This is because there is no timing information between the two sides of a link. The only way we can synchronize the two sides is to know where a character starts and stops. Normally we use two stop bits.

In the example shown, we have a single character being sent, with the binary code 0110010. We mentioned timing above. Our serial links can have a range of speeds; the standard bit rate speeds are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400. I have seen a 400kb/s speed quoted.

There are many examples of standard protocols which use serial links. The most common is RS-232. This is an old standard now and most laptops no longer have it. Every technical person has an adapter in their laptop case which allows them to use RS-232 over USB and you can buy an adapter like that on line for a few euros. If you don’t have one ORDER ONE NOW! You cannot configure network equipment of appliances without it. When you connect to a Cisco switch or router via a blue serial cable, this is RS-232.

If you are doing longer range serial connections, you might use a standard like RS-422 or RS-485. For very long connections in industrial sites, we use a 4-20mA current loop. For IoT sensors, I use 1-wire devices, a specific proprietary protocol that is both simple and cheap.

# Synchronous Communications
In some cases, we need something more precise than asynchronous communications. It may be desirable for us to synchronize the two sides of a communication circuit by including a clock signal on a separate line.

Using synchronous circuits, we can connect at multi-megabit rates. When you use legacy thick Cisco serial cables to connect to serial WAN ports on a router, this is a synchronous connection.
