# Phase
Phase is a very important concept to us. We say that a wave goes from one peak to another in 360° (like a circle). A wave that starts 30° after an initial wave is said to be 30° out of phase.

I created some extra columns in my Excel sheet, the graph below shows 3 SIN waves, 30° out of phase and 60° out of phase.
