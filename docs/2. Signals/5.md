# Angular Frequency
There are many ways we can measure angles, but radians are one of the most useful. If you trace the length of the radius around a circle, it will cover around 57° and this is one radian.

The circumference of a circle is 2π radians (think about it!).

Consider a rotating machine like a wheel. If it rotates once per second, it has an angular rotation frequency (ω) of 2π radians per second. The units will always be rads/second.
