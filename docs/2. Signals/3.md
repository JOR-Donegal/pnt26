# Noise
Along with any signal, we are always going to have noise. We use the term noise colloquially, the background hum that can make conversation difficult. In systems terms, noise is an irregular fluctuation, typically accompanying any electrical signal. The relationship between the noise level and the signal level is referred to as the signal/noise (S/N) ratio.

As atoms heat up, the random motions of electrons increase, this is the fundamental cause of electrical noise. Noise and temperature are closely associated. To make quantum computers operate, I need a cryogenic plant and temperatures very close to absolute zero.

Noise is incredibly important from a theoretical perspective and determines many of the characteristics of a telecommunications channel.
