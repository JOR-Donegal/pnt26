# Sine Waves
Consider a rotating machine like a wheel. If I divide the rotor into eight segments (45° each) and then plot the X axis in eight parts, I can get an idea of the path a point on that wheel will follow as it rolls.

This is a sine wave, and they appear in many aspects of nature. They are critical to our understanding of communications.

Its blocky and unnatural looking in my diagram (quick and nasty, generated in Excel), If I divided my circle into 16 or 32, it would look better!

From one ascending value to another is the wavelength (λ).

The frequency (f) is how many full cycles per second occur. I divided my wave into 8 segments, 360/8 = 45° and the time taken for that part of the wave to pass will be 1/8f.

The amplitude is the size of the wave, if this was an electrical wave, it might be the peak voltage.
