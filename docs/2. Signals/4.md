# Model - Generating a Sine Wave
Give this a go!

In Excel, Column A, I create a list of numbers from 0 to 430.

In column B, I insert the formula SIN(RADIANS(A1)) and apply it to the entire range.

I have created a SINE wave of amplitude 1. The wavelength (λ) is measured from zero crossing to zero crossing. The amplitude (A) is measured from zero to the peak of the wave.

I could also measure the peak-to-peak amplitude which would be 2A.
