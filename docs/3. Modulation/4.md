# Phase Modulation (PM)
Phase Modulation (PM) is a far more complex technique requiring sophisticated electronics. With PM, we encode information in the phase of a wave. This requires a high-quality communications channel with a minimum of noise. We use a special version of PM for sending digital signals, Phase Shift Keying or PSK.

In simple terms, we take a carrier signal and then figure out how good our communication channel is. Suppose our channel is so good, we can distinguish between eight phase changes in our wave or a phase shift of 45 degrees.

Now we can make zero phase shift equal to binary 000, we can make a 45-degree phase shift equal to binary 001 and so on. We have made each or the 8 possible phase shifts equal to a 3-bit binary symbol. This is great! It means we can transmit 3 bits of data for every single phase of the carrier. Again, in very simple terms, it means we can get 3,000 bits per second from a carrier at only 1 kHz.
