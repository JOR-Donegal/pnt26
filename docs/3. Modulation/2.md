# Amplitude Modulation (AM)
Amplitude Modulation is where the amplitude (or loudness) of the sound is used to modulate a carrier. A typical way to use AM is experienced when we listen to medium wave or long wave radio (called AM on many radio sets).

We start with a radio wave; in the case of RTE Longwave the carrier wave is 252 kHz or 252,000 Hz.

Suppose we modulate the amplitude of the carrier using an audible signal, the note middle C on a piano (261 Hz).
We can transmit a radio wave which varies in amplitude with the audio signal. This can be transmitted for hundreds of miles, with the audio signal recoverable by a radio receiver.
 
Amplitude modulation is simple and cheap to implement. However, it is impossible to distinguish noise from signal, and when the carrier becomes weak (called _fading_), so does the recovered audio.
