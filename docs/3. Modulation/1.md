A voice signal on an old fashioned telephone has most of its energy between 300Hz and 3.4KHz. Let us design a radio antenna to transmit 300Hz!

We know that the wavelength (λ) = c/f

If 

- c = 3 x 10 <sup>8</sup> m/s
- f = 300Hz

Then a full wavelength antenna would be λ = 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> / 300 = 1,000 kms long!



There are (a great number of!!) other reasons why it would be impractical to build a radio transmitter and receiver at these frequencies. We might prefer to pick radio frequencies for their propogation characteristics, equpment design, etc. This will be the _carrier_.

We can then change a property of this signal to transmit information, this is _modulation_. 

For the diagrams (AM, FM, PM) on the following pages, I did some very rough Python scripts (based on some scripts I generated from ChatGPT). Take a look at the
[code](https://github.com/JOR-Donegal/Modulation) and see if you can run it. If you are not familiar with virtual envirnments, read _prereqs.py_ and install the prerequisites before you begin.
