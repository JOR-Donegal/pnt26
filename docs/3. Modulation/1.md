A voice signal on an old fashioned telephone has most of its energy between 300Hz and 3.4KHz. Let us design a radio antenna to transmit 300Hz!

We know that the wavelength (λ) = c/f

If 

- c = 3 x 10^8 m/s
- f = 300Hz

Then a full wavelength antenna would be λ = 3 x 10^8 / 300 = 1,000 kms long!



There are (a great number of!!) other reasons why it would be impractical to build a radio transmitter and receiver at these frequencies. We might prefer to pick radio frequencies for their propogation characteristics, equpment design, etc. This will be the _carrier_.

We can then change a property of this signal to transmit information, this is _modulation_. 

For the diagrams (AM, FM, PM) on the following pages, I did some very rough Python scripts (base scripts via ChatGPT). Take a look at the
